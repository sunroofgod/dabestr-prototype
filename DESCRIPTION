Description: Data Analysis using Bootstrap-Coupled ESTimation.
  Estimation statistics is a simple framework that avoids the pitfalls of
  significance testing. It uses familiar statistical concepts: means,
  mean differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on the
  effect size of one's experiment/intervention, as opposed to a false
  dichotomy engendered by P values.
  An estimation plot has two key features:
  1. It presents all datapoints as a swarmplot, which orders each point to
  display the underlying distribution.
  2. It presents the effect size as a bootstrap 95% confidence interval on a
  separate but aligned axes.
  Estimation plots are introduced in Ho et al., Nature Methods 2019, 1548-7105.
